# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to Advent of Code 2021 in TypeScript

## Get Started

This repo runs using Deno as the runtime.

To create the file structure for each day, simply run `sh createDay.sh <YEAR> <DAY>`

This will create the directory for the day, get the input file necessary for the puzzle, and create code and test files.

## Run Tests

To run tests, run the following command: `deno test <TEST FILE NAME>`. Tests are written using the Deno test runner and Chai assertion library.
